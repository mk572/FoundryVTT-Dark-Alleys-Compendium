{"_id":"KFiZo0dlkyJqYP5K","name":"Taking Risks","permission":{"default":0,"A901bz1OKzb5sxyf":3},"folder":"","flags":{},"content":"<p>A core philosophy of 13th Age is that the action should always drive the story forward, as expressed in the Fail Forward rule (Core Book p. 42). The Taking Risks rule presented here expands on that philosophy.</p>\n<p>With Fail Forward, when a PC fails a check, they usually succeed at their goal if it drives the story forward, but suffer a bad consequence, or a new threat is introduced. The Taking Risks rule allows players to double down on that. If they fail on a roll, they can announce they want to take a risk and reroll. If the reroll is successful, the check is a normal success and no consequence happens.</p>\n<p>However, if the attempt fails, the PC suffers a setback that is a lot more grave than a Fail Forward. The consequence of a failed attempt at Taking a Risk should always be crippling, otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth calling it that way. The interpretation is up to the GM, but the table below provides some guidance. If in doubt, the GM can choose a result from this table, or have the player roll a d12:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Effects that you can save against during a quick rest always end on a full heal-up.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Taking a Risk means that the player steps in to try and avoid a Fail Forward result that would be detrimental to the party.</p>\n<p>Why would players want to take a risk when there is a guarantee that the story moves on despite the failure? The story moving on doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it continues in the PC&rsquo;s favor. If the campaign villain needs to collect three artifacts of doom to succeed at the ancient ritual to achieve godhood, the story still continues to its climax if the PCs fail to stop the villain from assembling these items before the big final confrontation. Even the death of a PC might still be a fail forward moment, when it leads to a heroic sacrifice and ultimate success of the rest of the party, or at least a clutch escape.</p>\n<p>The table below is for reference, you should use the integrated RollTable during the game: @Compendium[13a-dark-alleys-compendium.dark-alleys-variant-rules-risk-table.00h4dPiQkYS5xVmj]{Taking Risk}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 202px; width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5px\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 16.8614%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Roll</td>\n<td style=\"width: 31.0518%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Setback</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.586%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Consequence</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 16.8614%; height: 16px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 31.0518%; height: 16px;\">Hand injury</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.586%; height: 16px;\">Disadvantage on melee and ranged weapon attacks.
